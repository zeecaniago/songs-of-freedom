# Speaking Your Truth


Truth is not just internal; it needs expression. Speaking your truth can be terrifying, especially if it disrupts harmony or challenges expectations. Yet withholding your truth suffocates you. It breeds resentment and disconnect.

Begin small. Express a preference. Share an idea. Say “I don’t know.” Ask for what you need. Gradually, speak about the bigger things—your boundaries, your desires, your pain. Use “I” statements. Take responsibility for your feelings. Remember that you can be kind and honest at the same time. Truth spoken with compassion can liberate both the speaker and the listener.


## Discernment vs. Judgement


As you cultivate clarity, be mindful of the difference between discernment and judgement. Discernment is the ability to see things as they are and choose accordingly. Judgement is layered with moral condemnation. Discernment says, “This person’s energy doesn’t resonate with mine.” Judgement says, “This person is bad.” The former empowers; the latter alienates.
Practice discerning what is aligned for you without making others wrong for their choices. This cultivates humility and keeps your heart open.
