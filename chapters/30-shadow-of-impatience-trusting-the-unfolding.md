# Shadow of Impatience: Trusting the Unfolding


In many ways, impatience is a natural response. It’s a shadow that creeps in quietly. It often starts as a low-level restlessness—a desire to move things forward, to skip the waiting, to get to the outcome.

We live in a world that rewards speed. Faster results, quicker decisions, instant gratification. But when impatience becomes a pattern, it creates a constant sense of urgency that disconnects us from the present moment.

The energy of impatience says, “This moment is not enough.” It resists what is. It fixates on what’s missing, what’s delayed, or what’s not yet happening. When caught in this shadow, time feels like the enemy. Everything starts to feel like a race: healing, success, clarity, transformation.

Impatience often masquerades as drive or ambition. But underneath, there’s a deeper discomfort—an unwillingness to sit with uncertainty, to be with the in-between. It’s a form of internal pressure that says, “I’ll feel okay once I get there.” But “there” keeps moving. And we end up chasing peace while bypassing the very process that would lead to it.
