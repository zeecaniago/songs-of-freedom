# The Gifts of the Wound


Every wound holds a gift. The wound of rejection may teach you to anchor your worth internally. The wound of betrayal may teach you to trust your intuition. The wound of illness may awaken you to the preciousness of your body. The wound of oppression may ignite your voice for justice.

Instead of asking, “Why me?” ask, “What is this wound asking me to learn?” Do not rush to find meaning; some wounds take years to reveal their gifts. But hold the possibility that nothing is wasted, that even your deepest pain can become a source of wisdom and compassion.
