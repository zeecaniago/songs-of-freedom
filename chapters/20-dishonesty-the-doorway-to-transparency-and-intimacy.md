# Dishonesty: The Doorway to Transparency and Intimacy


Dishonesty is a shadow that doesn’t always show up in obvious ways. It’s not just about telling lies. Often, it’s about hiding our real feelings, avoiding hard truths, or shaping ourselves into something more acceptable so we don’t rock the boat. It can look like being agreeable on the surface while resentment builds underneath. It can look like saying, “I’m fine,” when we’re actually hurting or confused.

At the core, dishonesty is about fear. Fear of being misunderstood. Fear of being judged. Fear that if we show people who we really are—messy, unsure, emotional—we’ll be rejected or abandoned. So instead of showing up fully, we shape-shift. We perform. We keep things safe.

But safety comes with a cost.

When we stay in this shadow, our relationships begin to lose depth. We might still function on the surface, but something essential is missing. We’re never quite sure if people truly love us, because deep down, we know we haven’t been fully honest with them. We haven’t let them see the real us.

And if they don’t see the real us, how can we trust their love?

This creates a cycle of subtle disconnection. We yearn for closeness, but avoid the vulnerability that real closeness requires. We seek intimacy, but settle for comfort. Over time, this can lead to a quiet kind of loneliness—even when we’re surrounded by people.

The first step out of this shadow is recognizing where we’ve been dishonest—not just with others, but with ourselves. Where are we pretending? Where are we holding back? What are we afraid will happen if we speak the truth?

The key is not to judge ourselves for these patterns. Dishonesty, like all shadows, is a strategy we learned to protect ourselves. It likely served a purpose at some point. The work now is to shift from protection to connection—from hiding to revealing.

This is where the gift of transparency begins to emerge.
