# The Art of Receiving


Part of rising is learning to receive. Many of us are more comfortable giving—we equate it with worthiness. But receiving requires openness. It requires trust that you are worthy of love, support, abundance. It challenges the narrative that you must struggle alone.

Practice receiving compliments without deflecting. Accept help without apology. Allow yourself pleasure without guilt. Breathe in the nourishment life offers—sunlight on your skin, a stranger’s smile, a friend’s generosity. The more you can receive, the more you can give from overflow rather than depletion.
