# The Nature of the Shadow


The shadow of victimization doesn't make you weak. In fact, it often arises in those who feel deeply, who have endured real suffering, and who yearn for a better world. It’s not wrong to feel wronged. The problem arises when we become fused with the identity of the victim. When we repeat the same story so often that we forget there is a path beyond it.

In this state, we become reactive. We may fall into patterns of blame, helplessness, or passive waiting. We might unconsciously attract the same challenges over and over, not because life is punishing us, but because we haven't yet claimed the power that lies underneath the wound.

And this is the paradox of the shadow—it holds the very key to our liberation.
