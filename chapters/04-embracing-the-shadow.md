# Embracing The Shadow


We often imagine the descent as a single fall—one dramatic tumble from grace after which we dust ourselves off and climb back up. But in reality, descent is a series of gentle slips and soul‑quaking plunges, a dance with darkness that teaches us how to move in the in‑between.

The shadow is not a mistake. It is a repository of everything you thought you needed to hide in order to be loved. It holds your envy, your rage, your unmet needs, your unspoken desires. It whispers truths you were afraid to speak when the world expected you to shine without blemish.

When you turn toward your shadow, something miraculous happens: the monsters shrink. In the dim light of your awareness, the grotesque faces become familiar. A hunger for belonging. A fear of insignificance. A wound from a time you’ve almost forgotten. You see that what you feared was not evil but exiled innocence, waiting to be heard.

Sitting with your shadow is like befriending a wild animal. You cannot lunge forward and grab it, nor can you ignore it and hope it disappears. You breathe. You soften your gaze. You whisper, “I see you.” And slowly, the creature emerges. It shows you where you ache, where you still bleed, where the fire burnt you last. It invites you to pour compassion into those places. It invites you to reclaim the parts of yourself you disowned when they didn’t fit the story of who you were supposed to be.

The descent teaches you that darkness is not punishment; it is initiation. It breaks the illusion that you are separate from your pain, your joy, your divine madness. It cracks your heart open so that light can pour in from the inside.
