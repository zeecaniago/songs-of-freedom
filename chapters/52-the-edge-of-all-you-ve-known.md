# The Edge of All You’ve Known


At the edge of everything you thought you knew, there is a void. It is empty and full at the same time. It hums with potential. It holds all the versions of you that could have been and all the futures waiting to be birthed. In the void, there is no story to cling to, no identity to defend. There is only presence.

Some fear the void; they avoid it with busyness and noise. But if you dare to lean in, you will hear a whisper. It will not be in words; it will be a feeling, a knowing. It will remind you that you are not the roles you play, the achievements you collect, the mistakes you regret. You are awareness itself, temporarily housed in a body, learning to love through the crucible of human experience.

This whisper calls you home—not to a place, but to yourself. It invites you to rest in the simplicity of being. To trust that even as you burn and rise, descend and ascend, you are held. To know that you are the Phoenix and the fire, the star and the shadow, the descent and the ascent. To remember that liberation is not something you earn; it is the essence of who you have always been.
