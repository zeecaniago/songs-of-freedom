# The Wounded Hero


Prometheus was a Titan who defied the gods to bring fire—symbolic of divine knowledge—to humanity. For this act of rebellion, Zeus punished him with eternal torment: bound to a rock, his liver eaten daily by an eagle.

Prometheus could have become a symbol of helplessness. A victim of cosmic injustice. But the myth doesn’t end there. He becomes the embodiment of sacred defiance—a being who chooses to suffer for the elevation of others.

In him we see: Even in chains, one can be free. Prometheus’ fire represents the gift within the shadow. When we stop asking “Why me?” and start serving a higher purpose, we ignite our inner fire. We become initiates, not victims.

We admire heroes because they overcome impossible odds, slay the dragon, save the world. Yet we forget that every hero is wounded. The wound is what calls the hero to adventure; it is the place from which their power emerges.

You may carry wounds from childhood—moments when you were unseen, misunderstood, shamed. You may carry wounds from failed relationships, betrayal, illness, systemic injustice. These wounds are not badges of failure; they are openings through which life invites you to become more whole.

A wound that is hidden will fester. A wound that is exposed to light and air will heal. Healing does not mean the scar disappears; it means you can touch the scar without recoiling. It means you can speak of the wound without being flooded. It means you can meet others in their wounds with compassion rather than judgement.

The wounded hero embraces their vulnerability as part of their strength. They do not pretend to be invincible. They allow their pain to humble them. They cry in the arms of a friend. They ask for help. They learn to receive. And in doing so, they discover that there is power in softness, resilience in surrender, courage in tenderness.
