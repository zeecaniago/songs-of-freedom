# About the Author
[Your Name] is a writer and educator exploring the intersections of shadow, suffering, and liberation. Their work weaves mythology, psychology, and contemplative practice into accessible reflections on transformation in everyday life. When not writing, they can be found walking under open skies and listening for the quiet thread beneath the noise.
