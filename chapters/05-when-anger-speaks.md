# When Anger Speaks


One of the first voices you may hear in the descent is anger. You may have been taught to fear anger, to push it down, to label it as destructive. But anger is a compass. It points toward a boundary crossed, a value violated, a need unmet. It burns not to destroy but to illuminate what must change.

Allow yourself to feel your anger without acting it out. Let it flow through your body like molten lava, consuming old stories and clearing space for new growth. Ask it what it is defending, what it longs to protect. Perhaps it is guarding a younger version of you who learned to be silent to survive. Perhaps it is shielding your tenderness, your wildness, your dreams. Honour it. Thank it. Let it guide you to the places within you that ache for attention.
