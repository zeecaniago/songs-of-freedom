# An Echo from Old Java


In the time before kingdoms, when the spirits still whispered through banyan trees and volcanoes sang songs to the stars, there lived a goddess named Dewi Sekar Wangi—the "Goddess of Fragrant Blossoms." Her beauty was beyond compare, and her presence drew kings, sages, and even gods from distant realms to catch a glimpse of her.

But Sekar Wangi bore a secret.

Each morning, before she appeared to the world, she would bathe in the Lake of Illusions and don the Lotus Veil—a magical covering spun from the petals of enchanted lotuses. The veil did not only beautify her face; it cloaked her fears, silenced her doubts, and reflected back the desires of those who gazed upon her. People did not see her—they saw their fantasies.

Over time, the goddess forgot who she was beneath the veil.

One day, an old hermit named Ki Bisu came to the temple where she lived and offered her a simple flower. “This,” he said, “is the Bunga Sejati—the Flower of Truth. If you wish to know your essence, hold this flower as you gaze into the Moonwell.”

Sekar Wangi laughed. “Why should I need truth when I am adored by all?”

But the hermit only bowed and walked into the mist.

That night, restless and curious, she crept to the Moonwell. She removed the Lotus Veil and held the Bunga Sejati in her hands. As she peered into the water, she did not see her face—but a thousand others. Faces of women burdened with perfection, hiding their sorrows, performing roles, smiling through pain. Then, at the bottom of the well, she saw a child—herself—alone, wild-haired, laughing with muddy feet, eyes shining not from admiration, but aliveness.

In that moment, the veil disintegrated. And so did her image.

She became invisible to those who only sought her beauty. Her temple emptied. Her name faded from songs. But those who stayed—those who felt her rather than worshiped her—began to experience a new presence. One that listened, witnessed, embraced. One that did
not glitter, but glowed.

They called her not Dewi Sekar Wangi anymore, but Dewi Wening—the "Goddess of Stillness."

Shadow of Victimization

We all carry stories.

Some stories uplift us, remind us of our brilliance, and reconnect us to our sense of purpose. Others weigh heavy on the soul—stories of pain, betrayal, unfairness, or loss. The shadow of victimization lives in these stories. It’s not the pain itself that is the problem—it’s the grip we allow it to have over our identity.

Victimization is one of the most universal and potent of all human shadows. It whispers to us in quiet moments: “It’s unfair.” “If only things were different…”

It is subtle and pervasive. It can live in our daily complaints, in our resentment toward those who hurt us, in our longing for justice, or even in our beliefs that external forces control our destiny.

In its essence, victimization is the story of power given away. It is the forgetting that we are creators, not just characters in someone else's plot.

But like all shadows, this one carries a hidden gift—Freedom.
