# The Myth of the Lone Wolf


Many of us try to heal alone. We fear burdening others with our pain. We’ve been taught that independence equals strength. But the lone wolf myth leaves us isolated and exhausted. Healing happens in relationship—in the mirroring of another’s eyes, in the warmth of a hug, in the silence of shared grief.

Find your circle. It may be a trusted friend, a therapist, a support group, a spiritual community. Share your story. Listen to theirs. Let yourselves be seen. Vulnerability breeds intimacy; intimacy dissolves shame. When we realize we are not alone in our struggles, the burden lightens.
