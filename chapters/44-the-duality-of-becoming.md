# The Duality of Becoming


Throughout history, spiritual traditions have spoken of two great trees—the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death. The Tree of Life represents the sacred structure of existence, often depicted in Kabbalah as a diagram of interconnected spheres (Sephiroth), each embodying different aspects of wisdom, strength, love, and creation. It is a path of harmony and ascension, a guide to divine unity, self-awareness, and enlightenment.

Yet, the Tree of Death, also known as the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, tells a different story. In biblical and esoteric traditions, this tree represents self-awareness and the burden of duality—the capacity to discern between light and dark, order and chaos, suffering and liberation. In Genesis, eating from the Tree of Knowledge led to the “fall” of humanity, but it also granted something profound: the ability to see reality, to struggle, to awaken.

In some mystical teachings, this Tree of Knowledge is linked to the Qliphothic Tree—the shadow of the Tree of Life. If the Tree of Life represents divine harmony, the Qliphoth is the domain of entropy, suffering, and illusion—but not as punishment, rather as a process of necessary destruction and renewal. To ascend, we must first descend. To truly awaken, we must confront our suffering, illusions, and attachments—the very things that bind us.
