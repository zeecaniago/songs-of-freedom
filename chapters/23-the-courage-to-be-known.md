# The Courage to Be Known


Intimacy is not about merging with another person or losing ourselves in them. It’s about meeting them fully, as we are. It’s about letting ourselves be seen and seeing the other without filters. True intimacy begins when we drop the need to perform and allow ourselves to be fully human in front of each other.

This shift from dishonesty to intimacy is not always smooth. It requires us to face discomfort. It often brings up guilt or shame about where we’ve been hiding. But over time, transparency becomes a new kind of safety—not one based on avoidance, but on truth.

We begin to trust ourselves more. And others begin to feel that trustworthiness too.

This is how the Phoenix rises from this shadow—not by becoming perfect, but by becoming honest. Not by pretending to be the light, but by revealing the parts of ourselves we’ve kept in the dark.

And in doing so, we discover that the truth we were so afraid to speak is the very thing that sets us free.
