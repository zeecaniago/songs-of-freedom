# Dying to Be Seen


In the well-known myth, Narcissus is often depicted as vain—a young man so enamoured with his own reflection that he wastes away staring into a pool.

But there’s a deeper, more symbolic layer to this story when viewed through the lens of shadow and honesty.

Narcissus wasn’t just obsessed with his reflection—he was entranced by an image that could never truly touch him. The reflection was beautiful, yes, but it was distant, incomplete, and silent.

He longed for connection, but all he could engage with was an idealized version of himself—one that could not speak back, challenge him, or hold his pain. He didn’t die because he loved himself too much. He died because he was unable to look past the illusion of who he thought he should be and step into the vulnerability of real connection.

In this light, the myth becomes a cautionary tale—not about self-love, but about emotional dishonesty. About living behind a mask so polished that even we begin to believe it’s real. And about the loneliness and disconnection that come when we’re too afraid to let the mask fall.

In modern terms, Narcissus is the part of us that curates a version of our life, personality, or identity that looks good on the surface but keeps others (and ourselves) at arm’s length. It’s the fear that if we were to drop the performance and allow our raw, unfiltered truth to show—we might be rejected, or even shattered.

But here’s the paradox: transformation begins when the mirror breaks.

When Narcissus finally sees that the reflection is just that—a surface—he begins to grieve. And in that grief, we can imagine an alternate ending. One in which he doesn’t die, but instead turns away from the illusion and toward the world. Toward the messy, imperfect, relational space where intimacy can actually happen. Where being seen is a risk—but also a doorway to liberation.
