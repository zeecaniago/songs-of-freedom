# The Reality of Suffering


Buddha’s first teaching, Dukkha, states that suffering is an intrinsic part of existence. Everything is impermanent, and because we attach ourselves to fleeting things—identities, desires, relationships, illusions—we suffer.

The Qliphoth represents these attachments—our false identities, fears, and egoic structures that resist change. It is the husk of what remains when divine energy is trapped in illusion. Many view the Qliphoth as “evil,” but in reality, it is the mirror of suffering, reflecting all that must be released.

As long as we resist the impermanence of life, we remain trapped in the husks of the past, clinging to identities and structures that no longer serve us. The Qliphoth is not a curse—it is a test, a threshold. It forces us to face what we fear, to see the shadow we refuse to acknowledge. The Phoenix must first burn.
