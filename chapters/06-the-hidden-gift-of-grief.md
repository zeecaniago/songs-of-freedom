# The Hidden Gift of Grief


Beneath the flames of anger, you may find griefâ€”a weight that sits in your chest like a stone. Grief is not just about losing someone you love; it is about mourning the selves you never allowed yourself to be. It is about acknowledging the roads not taken, the voices not expressed, the affection withheld.

In grief, there is an invitation to honour. Honour what was lost. Honour what never came to fruition. Honour the way life unfolds in mysterious, often painful ways. When you give grief permission to flow, it washes away the debris of unresolved stories. Tears are not weakness; they are holy water. Let them cleanse you. Let them soften you. Let them remind you of the depth of your capacity to feel.
